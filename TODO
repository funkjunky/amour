TODO:

 **ORM System**
- write the class "Model" and the functions necessary
	- __get
		- do the select on the table, if we haven't already done so and cached it.
			- do a select on all data.
	- __set
		- simply set the variable
	- save
		- does an update on the table. If the id isn't set, then we insert.
	- delete
		- does a delete, only if an id is set, otherwise, just clear the vairables
	- static find_all(arrar(array())) <filters>
		- returns an array of model objects.
	- write a test model with my testblog and ensure everything works.
		- write the test model as a blank extended array
		- use our test page to test all the functionality

-Work on creating my Model View system that I will use for my own website, remember using pure and keeping things as streamlined as possible. Also admin should be a simple plugin kind of thing for the orm.
