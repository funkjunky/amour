TODO:

**database handler** (USE PDO)
 - Write a system to take in a table and an array of columns and output data
 	- write the amour class
	- add a function for selecting data
 - add inserting to the class
 - add a filtering system [use it in the select function]. Look at other systems, mainly Kohana ORM for how they do it.
 - add an update function that uses the new filtering system

 **ORM System**
 - write a class to inherit from that allows the user to get data through magic __gets and and automatically connects the database when first needed.
 	- write the class "Model" and the functions necessary
		- functions needed: __get, __constructor
			- __constructor
				-make sure we have a connection to the db already setup
			- __get
				-do the select on the table, if we haven't already done so and cached it. (this will involve a lot... I want everything to work as expected)

... write more ...
