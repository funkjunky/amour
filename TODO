TODO:

 **ORM System**
-add relationship to the model
	-do belongs_to first, because it should be easiest
	-do has_many [it should return an array of models indexed by id]
	-do has_many->through [through => true simply uses a cross ref table, otherwise its the same as has_many.]

**noSQL Support**
-support everything so far with noSQL
	* seperate classes for each database system (ie. SQLAmourDB, CouchAmourDB, etc.)
	* Each of these will inherit from AmourDB and inherit their own traits.
		-every function should probably be in a trait.
	* the model will call whichever one was set in the configs.
-consider all conviniences mapped to noSQL

-Work on creating my Model View system that I will use for my own website, remember using pure and keeping things as streamlined as possible. Also admin should be a simple plugin kind of thing for the orm.
