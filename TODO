TODO:

 **ORM System**
-add relationship to the model
	-do belongs_to first, because it should be easiest
	-do has_many [it should return an array of models indexed by id]
	-do has_many->through [through => true simply uses a cross ref table, otherwise its the same as has_many.]

-Work on creating my Model View system that I will use for my own website, remember using pure and keeping things as streamlined as possible. Also admin should be a simple plugin kind of thing for the orm.
