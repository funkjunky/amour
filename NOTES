Problems to consider and solutions to those problems
---
When we allow selecting columns and things vulnerable to injection attacks, add a column check to the AloreDB class. Allow caching of the column check:
"<table>.<column>" => "<column>", then grab the column from the cache.
Remember to not use the value given to use, but a value from the col query or cache.
